Introduction
Lung cancer is one of the most common and severe types of cancer worldwide. Early detection can significantly improve treatment outcomes. This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict lung cancer presence based on patient data.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes various patient features related to lung cancer. The data is cleaned and preprocessed before applying machine learning models.

EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
EDA involves visualizing the data to understand its structure, distribution, and relationships between features. Key steps include:

Checking for missing values

Visualizing feature distributions

Identifying correlations between features

Machine Learning Models
We implemented and compared the performance of several machine learning algorithms:

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Decision Tree

Random Forest

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Hyperparameter Tuning
Hyperparameter tuning was performed to optimize the model parameters and improve their performance. Techniques such as Grid Search and Random Search were used.

Results
The models were evaluated based on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results indicate which model performs best for lung cancer prediction.

How to Use
