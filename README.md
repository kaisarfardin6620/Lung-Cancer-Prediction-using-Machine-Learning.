Lung Cancer Prediction.


This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of lung cancer using various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and KNN. The project involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Hyperparameter Tuning to enhance model performance. The dataset used consists of patient features related to lung cancer, which are cleaned and preprocessed before applying the models. EDA includes checking for missing values, visualizing feature distributions, and identifying correlations. The machine learning models are evaluated based on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Techniques such as Grid Search and Random Search are employed for hyperparameter tuning. To use the project, clone the repository from GitHub, install the required packages, and run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts. The project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict lung cancer presence and improve treatment outcomes through early detection. The main contributor to this project is Fardin Kaisar.
